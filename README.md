# English-Dictionary-and-Thesauras
Aim of the project is to create an English dictionary &amp; thesaurus, which contains words, their meanings,  synonyms, antonyms and their traditional use in a sentence.

To store the dictionary electronically, Binary Search Tree (BST) is be used. This allows efficient access 
and modification of the dictionary data.

The user is able to add words and their related information in the dictionary as well as search and 
modify the words and their related data. The user can add the data in two different ways; Single word 
at a time and Multiple words at a time (input a text file containing multiple words and related data).
The data in BST is inserted using the word field chronologically.

The user can search the BST for the input word in two different ways; Single word search and Multiple 
words search (input file will contain multiple words); Output will be a text file containing words and 
their related data.

The user can modify the data in dictionary in two ways; Word modification (If the spelling of the 
entered word is incorrect) and Related data modification (E.g. updating meaning of a word).
